Below are the steps to execute the project and check the output.

1. Create these 3 folders manually in your m/c.

D:\up_w\aws_arch\input
D:\up_w\aws_arch\output
D:\up_w\aws_arch\backup

2.) Just Import this maven project in eclipse. (There is no need of any other configurations for mule )

3.) There is a file mule-examples.xml in src/main/app folder which contains 3 configurations.
Just execute these 3 configurations one by one by uncommenting the one you want to run and commenting the other two.

4.) To Run, follow below steps
Right click on project -> Run As -> Run Configuration.
Create the new Configuration under Java Application
In Main Tab : 
              a) Choose the main class as :  org.mule.MuleServer
In the arguments tab :
              a) In program arguments type :   -config src/main/app/mule-examples.xml
 	      b) In VM arguments type :        -Dlog4j.configuration=file:///${project_loc}\log4j.properties
Apply
Run


Below is the working description of each configuration ----> 

Configuration 1 : 
-----------------------------------------------
This configuration will poll the input folder every second for files in it, As soon as it finds 
the file in input folder, it will move that file to output folder. 
Also suppose file with name mule.txt arrives in input folder, than log message will appear in console as : Transferring file : mule.txt


Configuration 2 : 
-----------------------------------------------
This configuration will poll the folder input at an interval of 5 seconds for files in it, As soon as it finds 
the file in input folder, it will copy (not move ) that file to output folder.
Also suppose file with name mule.txt arrives in input folder, than log message will appear in console as : Copying file : mule.txt



Configuration 3 : 
-----------------------------------------------
This configuration will poll the folder input at an interval of 5 seconds for files in it, As soon as it finds 
the file in input folder, 
1) it will move that file to output folder, 
2) also it will take a backup of the file in backup folder.
3)  also it will move the file from input folder only when the file age is atleast .5 seconds ( to ensure the presence of complete file in case
of big files, 
4) It will name the backup file as filename.backup 
5) It will name the output folder file as timestamp-filename -->al of 5 seconds for files in it, As soon as it finds 
the file in input folder, it will copy (not move ) that file to output folder -->
